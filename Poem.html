        <h1>How Bright It Is</h1>
        <p>
            April. And the air dry
            As the shoulders of a water buffalo.<br>

        Grasshoppers scratch at the dirt,
        rub their wings with thin legs<br>
        flaring out in front of the soldiers
        in low arcing flights, wings a blur.<br>

        The soldiers don’t notice anymore,
        seeing only the wreckage of the streets,<br>
        bodies draped with sheets, and the sun,
        how bright it is, how hard and flat and white.<br>

        It will take many nails from the coffinmakers
        to shut out this light, which reflects off everything:<br>
        the calloused feet of the dead, their bony hands, 
        their pale foreheads so cold, brilliant in the sun.<br>
